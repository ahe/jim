== 0.2.0 [03-16-10]

* Major rewrite of the installer and version parser
  * Each file in a package is installed separately
  * Each file is installed with a package.json file that describes the install
    and is merged with any existing package.json files
  * version parser was rewritten and handles many different formats 
  * Existing JIMHOMEs are probably now invalid (SORRY!!)
* The install, specify, vendor, bundle workflow works from start to finish
* passing the -o option to bundle or compress outputs to STDOUT
* New commands:
  * available
  * pack
